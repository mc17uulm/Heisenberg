	abstract = {This research was designed to develop the definition of effective target width in a 2-dimensional pointing task. The idea of effective target width in a 1-dimensional pointing task was extended to effective target width in a 2-dimensional pointing task using the 2-dimensional joint probability density function. The validity of this theoretical definition was empirically verified. In the experiment, the moving direction of the mouse was from lower left to upper right. The approach angle was fixed to 45°. The fit of conventional and new models to the experimental data was compared by means of contribution of the regression line that showed the relation between the index of difficulty and the mean pointing time. As a result, we could obtain higher values of contribution for the modeling that introduced effective target width than that for the conventional modeling without it. In conclusion, the proposed 2-dimensional definition of effective target width may be promising for predicting and modeling pointing time in human-computer interactions.},

practicality of these dimensions for two pointing devices for
laptop computers, a finger-controlled isometric joystick and a
touchpad. Using a between-subjects design, evaluation of
performance using the measure of throughput was done for
one-direction and multi-directional pointing and selecting. Results
show a significant difference in throughput for the
multi-directional task, with the joystick 27\% higher; results for
the one-direction task were non-significant. After the experiment,
participants rated the device for comfort, including operation,
fatigue, and usability. The questionnaire showed no overall
difference in the responses, and a significant statistical
difference in only the question concerning force required to
operate the device - the joystick requiring slightly more force.
The paper concludes with a discussion of problems in implementing
the IS0 standard and recommendations for improvement.},

Neurophysiol. 79: 2833–2846, 1998. This study investigated the influence of different modalities of target information (visual, kinesthetic) on the accuracy, kinematics, and interjoint coordination of pointing movements to remembered targets. The targets were presented by a robot arm in five locations in three-dimensional (3D) space, either as a point of light in a dark room (“visual” condition), or kinesthetically. Relative pointing accuracy in the visual compared with kinesthetic conditions was influenced by the target location: pointing errors were the largest for the visual targets most eccentric relative to the subject's head. In addition, for the two most lateral targets, the final arm positions were, on average, closer to the center than the targets in the visual condition and farther from the center than the targets in the kinesthetic conditions. This result suggests that the pattern of errors in the visual condition described elsewhere (“range effect”) may derive from visual processing rather than motor planning and implementation. Two modes of kinesthetic target presentation were utilized. During “passive” kinesthetic presentation of the target, the experimenter moved the subject's relaxed arm. Alternately, in “active” kinesthetic presentation of the target, the subject actively (with minimal help from the experimenter) moved his arm. No visual feedback was allowed in either kinesthetic condition. The variability in the final fingertip position was significantly smaller in the active condition than in the passive condition. In contrast, variability in the final values of arm orientation angles did not differ significantly in the active and passive conditions. This apparent contradiction may be resolved by the fact that, for the given target location, the influence of the deviation of these angles in the given trial from their average values on the position of the fingertip tended to be mutually compensated, and this tendency was stronger in the active condition. Our analysis of the correlations among the arm orientation angles and of the relationship between the initial and final arm configurations suggests that the kinesthetic conditions enabled the implementation of a mixture of strategies for achieving accuracy. The first strategy is to use a specific memory of an adequate arm configuration (that assumed during target presentation), such that accuracy is achieved by using this memory as a template. The second strategy is to use synergistically coordinating joint angles, such that accuracy is achieved by focusing on a specific endpoint that can be reached by a range of equivalent arm positions. The latter strategy was better utilized in the active condition. In conclusion, our results indicate that human subjects can use diverse sensory information to achieve comparable final accuracy, but that the details of the strategies employed differ with the kind of information available.},

The first experiment used a 2D task constrained to the display surface, allowing direct validation against other 2D studies. The second experiment used targets stereoscopically presented above and parallel to the display, i.e., the same task, but without tactile feedback afforded by the screen. The third experiment used targets varying in all three dimensions. Results of these studies suggest that the conventional 2D formulation of Fitts' law works well for planar pointing tasks even without tactile feedback, and with stereo display. Fully 3D motions using the ray and mouse based techniques are less well modeled.},

	abstract = {Models of human motor behavior are well known as an aid in the design of user interfaces (UIs). Most current models apply primarily to desktop interaction, but with the development of non-desktop UIs, new types of motor behaviors need to be modeled. Distal pointing—pointing directly at a target that is remotely situated with respect to the input device—is such a motor behavior. A model of distal pointing would be particularly useful in the comparison of different interaction techniques, because the performance of such techniques is highly dependent on user strategy, making controlled studies difficult to perform. Inspired by Fitts’ law, we studied four possible models and concluded that movement time for a distal pointing task is best described as a function of the angular amplitude of movement and the angular size of the target. Contrary to Fitts’ law, our model shows that the angular size has a much larger effect on movement time than the angular amplitude and that the growth in the difficulty of the tasks is quadratic, rather than linear. We estimated the model's parameters experimentally with a correlation coefficient of 96\%.},

	abstract = {Everyday tools and objects often need to be customized for an unplanned use or adapted for specific user, such as adding a bigger pull to a zipper or a larger grip for a pen. The advent of low-cost 3D printing offers the possibility to rapidly construct a wide range of such adaptations. However, while 3D printers are now affordable enough for even home use, the tools needed to design custom adaptations normally require skills that are beyond users with limited 3D modeling experience. In this paper, we describe Reprise--a design tool for specifying, generating, customizing and fitting adaptations onto existing household objects. Reprise allows users to express at a high level what type of action is applied to an object. Based on this high level specification, Reprise automatically generates adaptations. Users can use simple sliders to customize the adaptations to better suit their particular needs and preferences, such as increasing the tightness for gripping, enhancing torque for rotation, or making a larger base for stability. Finally, Reprise provides a toolkit of fastening methods and support structures for fitting the adaptations onto existing objects. To validate our approach, we used Reprise to replicate 15 existing adaptation examples, each of which represents a specific category in a design space distilled from an analysis of over 3000 cases found in the literature and online communities. We believe this work would benefit makers and designers for prototyping lifehacking solutions and assistive technologies.},

We focus on pointing and investigate the effects of input device latency and spatial jitter on 2D pointing speed and accuracy. First, we characterize the latency and jitter of several common input devices. Then we present an experiment, based on ISO 9241-9, where we systematically explore combinations of latency and jitter on a desktop mouse to measure how these factors affect human performance. The results indicate that, while latency has a stronger effect on human performance compared to low amounts of spatial jitter, jitter dramatically increases the error rate, roughly inversely proportional to the target size. The findings can be used in the design of pointing devices for interactive systems, by providing a guideline for choosing parameters of spatial filtering to compensate for jitter, since stronger filtering typically also increases lag. We also describe target sizes at which error rates start to increase notably, as this is relevant for user interfaces where hand tremor or similar factors play a major role.},
